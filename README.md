# AdventOfCode
Some quick coding for Advent of Code 2018

They are unoptimized and mostly are just the first version of them without any refactoring

They only work with specific names of input file for their respective day ("DayX-input.txt" where X is a day number), 
  and they only print the output of their problem to a console.
  
Each coding file is divided into functions working to find the answer according to the parts of the problem,
  it's like this because I might come back to look at the code for my later rehearsal, and probably to do some more optimization.
